Today, I want to quantify the DNA and RNA concentration obtained from 4~mL of micro-algae cultures with the MasterPure\texttrademark~ kit.

\comment{I made sure the blanks are close to the baseline because it seems that last time something went wrong with the blank which lead to weird ratios.}

The absorbance measurments are shown in table \ref{tab:CJ20180215}. The 260/280 ratio measured for the DNA is 2.17 which is higher than the expected value of 1.8. But I am not worried about that because a high 260/280 purity ratio is not indicative of an issue (it is very likely due to the slightly alkaline pH of the Tris HCl which is known over-represent the ratio by 0.2â€“0.3). The 260/230 ratio measured for the RNA is 1.93 which is pretty good, but still a little lower than the expected values that are supposed to be between 2.0 and 2.2. This slightly low 260/230 ratio could be explained by the presence of contaminants absorbing at 230 nm such as \gls{edta}, carbohydrates, phenol, glycogen, or guanidine HCl. In this case, it cannot be phenol because I know there are not phenol involved in the MasterPure\texttrademark~ method. My guess is that this slightly low 260/230 ratio may be the resul of carbohydrate carryover which is known to be a problem with plants, and therefore - I suspect - with micro-algae.

The 260/280 ratio measured for the RNA is 2.01 which is the expected value! However, concerning the 260/230 ratio, it is a little lower than the expected values, which can be explained in the same way as it is for the 260/230 ratio measured for the DNA.

But overall, the spectra look a lot better than any I have obtained so far when extracting DNA and RNA from a single sample.
