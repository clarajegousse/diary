I basically did the same with the RNA sample as I did for the DNA. I used the same samples twice with different input volumes for the assay. And I repeated the measurement (including calibration) twice.

According these measurments, I have currently -- at least -- 1~\textmu g of RNA. But initially (before quantifications) I had 1.61~\textmu g of RNA. Knowing that this is the yield from 4~mL of micro-algae cultures, I hope to be able to retrieve even more nucleic acids from few liters of seawater.

The next step is to reverse transcribe these RNA samples (extracted with MasterPure\texttrademark~ and AllPrep) and then to amplify both cDNA and extracted DNA to see the contaminants are not inhibiting the downstream processes.
