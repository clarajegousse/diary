\subsubsection{Introduction}

I decided to repeat the AllPrep DNA/RNA extraction from the same type of samples

\subsubsection{Lysis}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Harvest 2~mL of micro-algae cultures.
\item Centrifuge for 2 min at 10 000 RPM at 4\degree C.
\item Discard supernatent.
\item Add another 2~mL of culture onto the already pelleted cells.
\item Centrifuge for 2 min at 10 000 RPM at 4\degree C.
\item Discard supernatent.
\item Add 600~\uL of Buffer RLT.
\item Mix by inversion.
\item Centrifuge the lysate for 3 min at maximum speed (15~300 RPM) at 4\degree C.
\item Transfer carefully the supernatent to an AllPrep DNA spin column placed in a 2~mL collection tube.
\item Close the lid.
\item Centrifuge for 30 sec. at 10000 RMP.
\mistake{Instead of 10000 RPM, I set the speed at 8000 RPM by mistake.}
\item Use the flow-through for RNA purification: proceed to Total RNA purification.
\item Place the AllPrep DNA spin column in a new 2~mL collection tube and keep at room temperature.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Total RNA purification}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add 1 vol. of 70\% ethanol to the flow-through collected previously. 
\item Mix well by pipetting.
\item Transfer up to 700~uL of the sample to an RNeasy spin column placed in a 2~mL collection tube.
\item Centrifuge for 15 sec. at 10000 RMP at 4\degree C.
\mistake{Instead of 10000 RPM, I set the speed at 8000 RPM by mistake.}
\item Discard the flow-through.
\item Add 700~\uL of Buffer RW1 to the RNeasy spin column.
\item Close the lid.
\item Centrifuge for 15 sec. at 10000 RMP at 4\degree C.
\item Discard the flow-thought.
\item Add 500~\uL of Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column.
\item Close the lid.
\item Centrifuge for 15 sec. at 10000 RMP at 4\degree C.
\item Discard the flow-thought.
\item Add 500~\uL of Buffer RPE to the RNeasy spin column.
\item Close the lid.
\item Centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed at 4\degree C.
\comment{Here I forgot to increase the speed: 2 min centrigation at 10000 RPM.}
\item Discard the flow-thought.
\item Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 1.5~mL collection tube.
\item Add 50~\uL of RNase-free water directly to the spin column membrane. 
\item Close the lid gently.
\item Centrifuge for 1 min at 10000 RPM to elute the RNA.
\comment{I repeated the elution of the RNA with an extra 30~\uL of RNase-free water, which makes a final volume of 80~\uL of RNase-free water containing the RNA.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Genomic DNA purification}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Add 500~\uL of Buffer AW1 to the AllPrep DNA spin column from the Lysis.
\item Close the lid.
\item Centrifuge for 15 sec. at 10000 RPM at 4\degree C to wash the column membrane.
\item Discard the flow-thought.
\item Add 500~\uL of Buffer AW2 to the AllPrep DNA spin column
\item Centrifuge for 2 min at maximum speed at 4\degree C to wash the column membrane.
\comment{Here I forgot to increase the speed, so I waited until the 2 min centrigation at 10000 RPM were finished and I centrifuge again for 15s at maximum speed.}
\item Place the AllPrep DNA spin column in a new 1.5~mL collection tube.
\item Add 100~\uL of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8) to the DNA AllPrep spin column membrane and close the lid.
\item Incubate at room temperature for 1 min.
\item Centrifuge for 1 min at 10000 RPM to elute the DNA.
\comment{I added an extra 50~\uL of Tris-HCl to the column, incubate 1 min and centrifuge at 10000 RPM for 1 min to make sure all DNA was eluted.}
\end{enumerate}

Overall, this procedure was pretty quick: it took me about 1H30 to complete the protocol and I was taking my time. 

I store the DNA and the RNA samples at -20\degree C and I will quantify this afternoon.
