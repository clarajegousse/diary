\comment{It is exactly the same as what was done on the 20180215.}

In table \ref{tab:20180227_nuc_acid_qnt}, the quantities of DNA are calculted based on the volume left: I know I eluted my DNA with 2 x 100~\uL of Tris HCl buffer which makes it a total 200~\uL, then I used 2~\uL for the NanoDrop\cR measurments and finally I use 5~\uL and 10~\uL for the Qubit\texttrademark~ assay. Which means the volume left us 183~\uL. But based on these results, the original amount of DNA I was able to retrieve is -- at least -- 1542 ng, which is more 1~\textmu g of DNA!

This is the highest DNA yield I have ever obtained (even higher than when I was working with more starting material!) which could mean that the bead beating is really helping to break cells.
