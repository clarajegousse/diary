My final volume was 80~\uL, but I used 2~\uL for the NanoDrop and 5 and 10~\uL for the Qubit\texttrademark Assay. So my volume is now 63~\uL. Knowing the concentration, I know I actually retrieved at least 315.2 ng of RNA. It's about three time less than what I usually get.
It is surprising that my DNA yield is actually higher than my RNA yield. 

So either the bead beading damages the RNA and not the DNA. Or the maybe the step of drying the RNeasy spin column was very important. 

I must think of other reasons why this happens.
