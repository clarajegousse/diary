Pauline was on maternity leave, and now she is back. She already gave me feedbacks on my protocol for \gls{sip}.

\subsubsection{Agenda}
% Here is the meeting agenda
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[-] Review \gls{sip} protocol.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Do not use TE buffer but 10 mM Tris HCl (better for downstream processes)
        \item "Pousseur de gradient"?
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item[-] Sybr Gold (check the difference before/after DNase or RNase treatment on agarose gel, or after PCR)
    \item[-] iodic cyanol a la place the CsCl?
    \item[-] PEG 6000: invest in your own
    \item[-] Check your primers in BLAST
    \item[-] Gentle bead beating: 3 times 10 sec. instead of two times 30 seconds with icy bath between each round
    \item[-] Gentle DNase treatment at room temperature for one hour rather than 30 min at 37\degree C.
\end{enumerate}

\comment{It was a nice meeting, and I got a lot of tips or ideas to work better in the lab.}
