It was a long meeting, mainly about grants, proposals and new projects. Viggó mentioned that there might be a new Ph.D. student coming.

\sidenote{Excused: Pauline Vannier on maternity leave, Mia Cerfonteyn is at sea, Alexandra Klonowski and Anouk Lyver were sick and Gregory Farrant is off today.}
\begin{itemize}
\item Viggó: Funding \& proposals, three EU proposals were submitted on 13th Feb., two proposals in same call: MASTER (Viggó, Sigurlaug, Stephen, René), SIMBA (Greg \& Alex), microbiome applications for food \& biotech applications, SustainME in different call, Matís leading, 2 stage proposal, Rannis: MicroFiberGut \& AquaBiome (re-submission on 25th Jan), IceGutHealth (Grant of Excellence, not funded, will be re-submitted), AirMicrome was funded, currently planned to get PhD for project, EiT-Food proposal ThermoBlue, project with Keldur and Landspitallin, funded by European Food Security agency about bacteria in (exported) food, whole genome sequencing of E. coli strains from various environments, antibiotic resistance, maybe bigger planned grant with USA
Pauline V coming back full-time on 26th Feb.
Sigurlaug \& Alex more involved in MIME to help Mia, Clara \& Anouk
Travel to last MASE meeting (Ireland) \& kick-off meeting ITN project SaltGiant (visitor will be coming to Matis), both last week of Feb.
\item Interns: Bastien leaving on Sunday, need to keep all information, create folder for interns in m:/6000
Teaching: HÍ, number of PhD students linked to amount of teaching, LHÍ teaching will be linked to new HÍ position
\item Question from Pauline: Access of interns to files; Viggó should not have access to m: drive, give documents directly
René: SustainME done, starting again on Aquaculture Pathogens (AVS), working on Europlanet, helping applicants, Whey To Wine, will finish Grænavatn work, paper was just published based on old Vör data
\item Stephen: still working on PhD…, AquaBiome submitted, microbiome of Arctic Char, FishGutHealth, intern Héléne will prepare libraries \& isolates, Infrastructure fund (Rannis) robot for routine DNA extraction
\item Clara: DNA \& RNA extractions, “lack” of RNA due to old quantification kit, testing methods on phytoplankton cultures, promising results for method optimization
\item Pauline: new intern Julie (until August), will do isolation of new strains from Surtsey; cultivation of new strains problematic, maybe time problem, need looong time to grow (years – centuries), Miseq run planned for various types of Surtsey samples, installation of freeze mill, abstract accepted for conference poster, Jules Verne proposal accepted
\item Sigurlaug: SafeFishDish, big experiment in January, MicroFiberGut, testing methods \& kits, Virus-X, planning on papers based on old isolated viruses, linked to CRISPR/Anti-CRISPR, safety committee work.
\end{itemize}
