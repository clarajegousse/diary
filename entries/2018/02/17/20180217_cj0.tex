I measure the concentrations of DNA obtained by reverse transcription from RNA samples obtained with MasterPure\texttrademark~ or AllPrep kits from micro-algae cultured cells.

Also I use the Qubit\texttrademark~ dsDNA BR assay and not the ssDNA assay because last time I tried to quantify some cDNA, it failed, and I remember discussing this with Stephen and he told me it is likely that the cDNA becomes double stranded.

\comment{The cDNA concentrations are lower than what I expected so maybe it was not a smart idea to add the 30~\uL of water like it is suggested in the Protoscript First Strand Synthesis protocol. The previous time I used this protocol, I remember that I skiped this last dilution step, I should have done the same.}
