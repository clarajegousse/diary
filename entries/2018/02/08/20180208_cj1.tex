The concentration measured with the Qubit\texttrademark~ allows me to calculate the total amount of DNA obtained which is 214.72 ng of DNA. This is not bad and it should enough for an amplification by \gls{pcr}. But it is not enough for metagenomics HiSeq sequencing because the TruSeq\texttrademark~ DNA PCR-Free library preparation kit requires 1~\textmu g of DNA.
