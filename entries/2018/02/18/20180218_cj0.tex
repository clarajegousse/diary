\subsubsection{Introduction}
Today, I will basically repeat the same experiment as yesterday. I will try to amplify the DNA and cDNA extracted from micro-algae cultures two different kits: the MasterPure\texttrademark~ by Epicentre and the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit by Qiagen. The only difference is that I will try to amplify these samples with eukaryote primers \texttt{EUK1}.


\subsubsection{Description of the DNA templates}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{{\color{Grass} CJ20180201\_MP}}: DNA extracted from 2~mL micro-algae culture with modified MasterPure\texttrademark~ kit.
\item \texttt{{\color{Aqua} CJ20180207\_AP}}: DNA extracted from 2~mL micro-algae culture with AllPrep kit.
\item \texttt{{\color{Lavender} CJ20180213\_AP}}: DNA extracted from 4~mL micro-algae culture with AllPrep kit.
\item \texttt{{\color{Sunflower} CJ20180214\_MP}}: DNA extracted from 4~mL micro-algae culture with modified MasterPure\texttrademark~ kit.
\item \texttt{CJ20180217\_MP1+}: cDNA obtained by reverse transcription \sidenote{Reverse transcription achieve with ProtoScript First Strand Synthesis by New England Biolab.} from RNA extracted from 2~mL micro-algae culture with modified MasterPure\texttrademark~ kit. 
\item \texttt{CJ20180217\_AP1+}: cDNA obtained by reverse transcription from RNA extracted from 2~mL micro-algae culture with AllPrep kit. 
\item \texttt{CJ20180217\_AP2+}: cDNA obtained by reverse transcription from RNA extracted from 4~mL micro-algae culture with AllPrep kit. 
\item \texttt{CJ20180217\_MP2+}: cDNA obtained by reverse transcription from RNA extracted from 4~mL micro-algae culture with modified MasterPure\texttrademark~ kit. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Description of controls}
My controls are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[+] diluted DNA from \textit{Thermoanaerobacterium sp.} (Bacteria)
\item[+] DNA from \textit{Thermococcus barophilus} 1 ng/\uL (Archeae)
\item[-] DNA from Cod 1 ng/\uL (Eukaryote)
\item[-] Autoclaved MilliQ water
\end{itemize}

\important{I did not have do use archaeal and bacterial DNA, but I am so used to defrost them before doing a PCR, that I did it anyways. So I decided to use them which will allow me to make sure these DNA are not amplified.}


\subsubsection{Description of the polymerase}

I will use the \href{https://www.neb.com/products/m0481-onetaq-hot-start-dna-polymerase#Product%20Information}{OneTaq\cR Hot Start DNA polymerase} by New England BioLabs with the \gls{emp} primers.

\subsubsection{Description of the primers}

\texttt{EUK1} is the primer set corresponding to the V4 region of the 18S rRNA gene. It is the 3NDf and V4\_euk\_R2 published by \citet{braate2010freshwater}.


\subsubsection{Preliminary setup}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Defrost all reagents and samples on ice (1h). \sidenote{It is very important that reagents (especially primers and dNTPs) are fully defrosted otherwise the concentration will not be accurate.}
\item Place all required material in LabCair \gls{pcr} Workstation and turn on \gls{uv} light for at least 20 min.
\comment{I forgot to place gloves under \gls{uv} lights. Too bad, I will just sterilise my gloves with ethanol and use few drops of RNase Zap.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Methods}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Work in LabCair \gls{pcr} Workstation
\item Multiply the volume of each reagent by the number of individual \gls{pcr} reactions you wish to perform (including the positive and negative controls) and add 2 extra to account for pipetting error (see table \ref{tab:20180218_mastermix}).
\comment{I have 8 samples, 4 controls, and 2 extra, which means I must prepare a master mix for 16 reactions.}
\item In a single 1.5mL-Eppendorf tube combine the following:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sterile dH2O
	\item 5X OneTaq Reaction Buffer
	\item OneTaq GC Enhancers
	\item dNTP mix (10 mM each nt)
	\item primers (EUK1 primers)
	\item OneTaq\cR Hot Start DNA Polymerase
	\end{itemize}
\item Mix the contents by gently pipetting up and down several times (keep tube on ice)
\item Transfer  22.5 \textmu L of Master Mix into small \gls{pcr} tubes
\item add 10 \textmu L of \gls{dna} template in each \gls{pcr} tube (on the pre-PCR bench) following the layout shown in figure \ref{tikz:20180218_pcr_racks}.
\item Secure the tops to the \gls{pcr} tubes
\item Tap gently tubes to mix up everything
\item Centrifuge briefly to bring all the liquid to the bottom before placing it in the \gls{pcr} machine
\end{enumerate}
\comment{I finished the tube of OneTaq Hot Start Polymerase (lucky I ordered some recently).}

\comment{Figure \ref{tikz:20180218_pcr_racks} shows the actual layout of the samples in the rack, but I must admit this layout is not the most logical. In a way, rack \#6 contains all controls while rack \#2 contains reactions mix with DNA and cDNA templates.}

I used the preset method on the thermocycler.

\important{I increased the number of cycles from 30 to 35 cycles.}
