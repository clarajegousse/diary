\subsubsection{1\% Agarose gel preparation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Measure with erlenmeyer 75~mL of 1\% agarose gel.\sidenote{The 1\% agarose gel is kept at 60\degree C in the gel room.}
\item Warm up the erlenmeyer for 15s in microwave: agarose will be more fluid and it will avoid bubbles when casting the gel
\item Add 3.75~\textmu L of SYBR Safe to the agarose while swirling \sidenote{SYBR Safe by Invitrogen, 10,000X in \gls{dmso}}
\item Cast the gel with the comb (for 20 wells)
\item Let the gel set for 20 min
\end{enumerate}

Just after the coffee break, my \gls{pcr} products are ready and waiting for me in the thermocycler at 4\degree C. 

\subsubsection{\gls{pcr} products preparation}

With a multichanel pipette:
\begin{itemize}
\item 5~\textmu L of each sample of \gls{pcr} product
\item 5~\textmu L of blue dye (bromothymol blue)
\item Tap gently tubes to mix up everything
\item Centrifuge briefly to bring all the liquid to the bottom
\end{itemize}

\comment{The multicanal pipette was not good today, so the volumes were clearly not accurate, but it does not really matter for this purpose.}

\subsubsection{Electrophoresis}

For this electrophoresis migration, we run:
\begin{itemize}
\item 9~\textmu L of each sample of \gls{pcr} products
\item 5~\textmu L of the 1~kb ladder
\item 5~\textmu L of the 100 pb ladder
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Place the agarose gel into the gel box (electrophoresis unit) containing TAE buffer
\item Load 5~\textmu L of molecular weight ladder into the first and last lane of the gel
\item Load 9~\textmu L of each sample into the additional wells of the gel
\item Run for 50~min with the \gls{eps} 301 at 100~V, 400~mA
\item Visualize your \gls{dna} fragments with \gls{uv} lights
\end{enumerate}

\comment{I place the samples on the gel with rack \#2 first followed by rack \#6.}
