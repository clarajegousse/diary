I recently received a new Qubit\texttrademark~ RNA BR Assay Kit. In order to test this new kit, I take all the RNA samples that I have in my collection to quantify the amount of RNA left (knowing that RNA usually degrades itself pretty quicky even at -20\degree C).

All these results are actually pretty surprising! Even my oldest sample still contains RNA. And even for samples I though did not contain RNA (or with RNA concentration below detection level) seems to contain at least 288 ng of RNA.

So now, I truly suspect that the other Qubit\texttrademark kit is too old. I had troubles calibrating the Qubit\texttrademark \sidenote{I was not the only one having problems to achieve calibration with this kit, I know El√≠sabet and Pauline Bergsten had the same issue.} and I had noticed that the stain was pretty pale while most of the nucleic acid stains have bright colours.
