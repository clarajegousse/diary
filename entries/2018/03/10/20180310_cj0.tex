\comment{I arrived a little after 10:00 AM and I was showing Helene how to switch off the alarm system. Ali is also here today so we plan to have lunch together.}

I prepared boxes, and I start transfering samples from the liquid nitrogen to the -80\degree C freezer, and each time, I make sure I log the sample information into an excel spreadsheet.

I took me the whole day and I am not even done, but I just can't continue because I can feel that I will start making mistakes now.
