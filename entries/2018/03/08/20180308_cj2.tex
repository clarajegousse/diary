We must fill up some online form for the tax system here in Iceland, but the form is all in Icelandic, so Hróar spends one hour helping Anouk and I to do it.
\comment{Doing this, he realised that for some weird reasons my request for sport membership support was not recorded even though I remember doing it and I have proves with the emails and the comment left on the Matís Workplace social media. So Hróar said he will fix it next month which is very nice of him!}
