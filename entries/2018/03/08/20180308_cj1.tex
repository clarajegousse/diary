The 10L-Nalgene bottles used for metagenomic samples need to be cleaned. For each of the four bottles, I use soapy water and I shake the bottle, before rinsing it with tap water. Once there is no more bubbles, I rinse 3 times. Then I rinse three times with dH2O (approx. 1L each rinse). Then I dry the bottles overnight at 40\degree C.

After that, I will only need to autoclave the bottles, and leave them under UV for extra sterilisation (and removal of DNA).
