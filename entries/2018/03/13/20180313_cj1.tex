\comment{It is exactly the same as what was done on the 20180215.}

For the Qubit\texttrademark~ DNA BR Assay, I consider that I have 4 samples: the two standards and one DNA sample that I will measure twice, once using 5~\uL and once using 10~\uL.

Also, I repeat the measure three times. The first time, I use the old calibration. The second time, I re-calibrate the spectrophotometer with the standards prepared by myself.

Because I received a new Qubit\texttrademark~ DNA BR assay kit last week, I want to make sure the measurments are consistent. So today, I will quantify the DNA with the old kit (\texttt{LOT:\#1835789}) and then with the new one (\texttt{LOT:\#1927400}). Measurments obtained with the old kit are presented in table \ref{tab:20180313_nuc_acid_qnt} and  Measurments obtained with the new kit are presented in table \ref{tab:20180313_nuc_acid_qnt_new_kit}. It seems that the results are fairly consistent and therefore I can \textit{trust} the new kit.

In table \ref{tab:20180301_nuc_acid_qnt}, the quantities of DNA are calculted based on the volume left: I know resuspended the DNA 50~\uL of Tris HCl buffer, which means I was able to obtain at least 850 ng of DNA. Then I used 2~\uL for the NanoDrop\cR measurments and finally I use 5~\uL and 10~\uL twice for the Qubit\texttrademark~ assays. Which means the volume left us 18~\uL in which I have - at least - 300 ng of DNA left.
