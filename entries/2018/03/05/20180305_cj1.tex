Since I brought back the samples collected during the winter survey, I must filter the seawater that was collected. So the first step is to set up the filtration system in the teaching lab. Everything worked perfectly fine, and I just made sure to rinse the filtration system: in each 1L bottle of the filtration device, I rinse it once with tap water, and once with distilled MilliQ water (using a \textit{dummy} 0.45\textmu m Sterivex\texttrademark filter). Doing this fake filtration with MilliQ water is time consuming but it allows me to check that the filtration is working fine and fix the pipe connections with parafilm.
