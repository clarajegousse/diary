\persons{Tómas Ármann Hafsteinsson, Kristinn Guðmundsson, Mia Cerfonteyn}

According to MarineTraffic\sidenote{\url{www.marinetraffic.com}} the research vessel - Bjarni Sæmundsson - came back to Reykjavík on Sunday 4\textsuperscript{th} March at 01:00 PM (cf. figure \ref{fig:20180305_marine_traffic_bjarni}). After contacting Kristinn Guðmundsson to make sure the crew would be on board to help me with the crane, Tómas and I went to fetch the samples and Mia's personal belongings. We brought back the bottles of seawater with 1\%lugol to Matís and then we had to go back to the harbour to fetch the two liquid nitrogen tanks and bring them back to Matís.
\mistake{One of the two nitrogen has no more cap. Mia warned me about this, apparently it was damaged during the survey.}
