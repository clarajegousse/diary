I had issues with the Qubit because there was 4 tubes of Standard \#2 and at first the calibration failed. Pauline was in the lab with me at that time, and she confirms with me that she also had issues with this kit before, and she gave up but apparently El√≠sabet succeded after few trial. So I decide to prepare an assay for 6 samples (using STD \#1 and foud STD \#2 and my actual RNA sample). I used 1\uL of my extracted RNA sample.

Actually, when trying to calibrate the Qubit with STD \#1 and the first STD \#2, it was fine, then the Qubit measured 42.5 ng/mL which lead to a calculated concentration in my sample to be 8.49 ug/mL.
