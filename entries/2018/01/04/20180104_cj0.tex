\subsubsection{Needed input}
% Here you can write which input you need and what you would like to discuss
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-] When will be the Winter survey?
	\comment{It will be in February 2018.}
	\item[-] How long will be the Winter survey?
	\comment{Probably 3 weeks.}
    \item[-] Is it possible that only one of us goes on the Winter survey?
    \comment{Yes, Anouk Lyver will be going.}
    \item[-] Follow the same sampling plan as in August? The sampling plan in August was slightly lighter than the one followed during the Spring survey.
    \comment{Yes, especially because Anouk will have to collect zooplankton samples, so the a less intensive sampling will be better. Possibility to use lugol to preserve samples which will allow to filter samples later on land.}
\end{itemize}
