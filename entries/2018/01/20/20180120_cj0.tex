Today is the day of our PCR PARTY! Mia, Anouk and I decided to come on a Saturday so we can have the lab for ourselves and avoid getting distracted.

\subsection{Normalisation of extracted DNA concentrations}
% The part of the label after the colon must match the file name. Otherwise,
% conditional compilation based on task labels does NOT work.

To proceed all the \gls{pcr}, we must first normalised the concentration so we can prepare all samples for \gls{pcr}. 

We think that the working with 5 ng of DNA template for the \gls{pcr} so we think working with 25~\uL of DNA extract that are 1ng/\uL would be the best so we just have to add 5\uL of DNA template which is 5ng of DNA.

The plan is Amplification by PCR with EMP primers and Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase of DNA extracted from Kögur 5 station.
