Mia talk to Stephen, and he recommends that one of us tries the kit following the manufacturer's protocol. We also want to try to use our own lysis solution for and then use the kit for the isolation of the DNA. Anouk is planning to test these extraction methods on some extra samples that Mia collected during the winter solstice.
