Yesterday, a tube containing chloroform broke in the centrifuge. Because Chloroform is a toxic solvent, I decided not to clean it right away to give it some time to evaporate. After about 24 hours, I can still somehow smell it (which makes me worried for my health) but I wiped off everything with ethanol and tissues. I placed all tissues and other tubes and tips in a sealed plastic bag to discard it safely. 

Also, the white plastic bucket to discard phenol-contaminated items was full in the chemical room on the first floor, so I prepared a new one and I also set up a new white plastic bucket for phenol contaminated items upstairs in the teaching lab with the help of Beata.
