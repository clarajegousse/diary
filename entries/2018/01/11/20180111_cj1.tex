The meeting was about all the actions that will be taken to make Matís more environmentally friendly by sorting and recycling waste, by reducing power needs and carbon footprint. 

\comment{I feel like it's a great action and I have plenty of little ideas to suggest such as using frabric cloths instead of paper tissues, or also making compost with food waste.}
