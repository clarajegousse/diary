According to the concentrations of DNA read by the Nanodrop, I decided to use the broad range assay kit.\sidenote{It is about 01:30 PM when I start the Qubit\texttrademark ~dsDNA BR Assay.}
\sidenote{Qubit\texttrademark dsDNA BR Assay Kit (LOT:\texttt{1835789}) was opened by Elísabet Eik Guðmundsdóttir on the \texttt{20170817}.}

First, I use 1~\uL of each of my samples for this assay, but all the values are below the detection threshold. So I repeat the assay with 5~\uL of DNA sample.

\begin{tabular}{l r r r r}
\toprule
Sample ID & \textmu g/mL & $V_f$ (mL) & m (\textmu g) & m (ng) \\ \midrule\texttt{DNA\_ALMIX} & 0.776 & 0.042 & 0.032 & ~32 \\
\texttt{DNA\_423} & TOO LOW & 0.042 & NA & NA \\
\texttt{DNA\_CTRL} & TOO LOW & 0.042 & NA & NA \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

This means I have not been able to extract the DNA from the bacterial cultures. I am starting to think that I should really reconsider this protocol, and maybe just split my samples to process separately the DNA extraction and the RNA extraction.
