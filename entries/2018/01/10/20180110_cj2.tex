After the quantification with the NanoDrop, I perform a quantification of the RNA with the Qubit\texttrademark RNA HS assay kit. 
\comment{Because I had issues with the calibration last week, I decide to prepare an assay for 7 samples which would include all the STD 2.}

Like last time, I struggled with the calibration, but it eventually worked. Then I run the analysis of my samples (I used 1\uL of samples), but both are below the detection range. So I decided to repeat the assay with 5 \uL of my samples, but again it is below detection level. So the conclusion is that there is no RNA in these samples.

Actually, I suspect that the culture were actually dead which means I performed the extraction on dead cells which would have no more RNA. DNA should be more stable, but unfortunately the tube broke ...

So I must start again from scratch.
