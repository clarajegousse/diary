Despite the broken tube and loss of DNA, the RNA was left to incubate overnight at -20\degree C. 

\subsubsection{Washing and resuspensing of RNA}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pellet RNA from previous steps by centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed at 4\degree C.
\comment{After the first centrifugation, I can already see a pellet.}
\item Discard carefully supernatent.
\item Repeat previous steps until all RNA and RNA are respectively combined into one single 2mL-Eppendorf tube.
\comment{I repeat the centrifugation steps 4 times.}
\item Dry the pellet for about 10 min at room temperature.
\comment{I left my tubes open at room temperature for about 30 min, but still some ethanol remained.}
\sidenote{Never dry the RNA pellet using a vacuum centrifuge.}
\item Dissolve the nucleic acids in 50 \uL of \gls{depc}-treated water.
\sidenote{I used \gls{depc}-treated water instead of Tris buffer.}
\end{enumerate}

\comment{The pellet looks chunky and breaks into pieces but it does not seem to dissolve.}

I leave my samples on ice for one hour before I do the quantification.
