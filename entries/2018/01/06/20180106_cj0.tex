I will follow the same protocol as I did last time (cf. sections \ref{task:20170815_cj0,task:20170815_cj1}) using the ProtoScript\cR First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit by New England BioLabs (Lot:0041411).

\subsubsection{Preliminary setup}

\important{The ProtoScript\cR~ First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit that is available at the moment in the lab is the one Pauline Vannier used for her previous work. It expired on 11/15 (Lot: 0041411); so it's been two years that this kit is expired, but it was kept at -20\degree C. If this experiment fails, it could be because the reagents are too old.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Thaw kit components and total \gls{rna} samples on ice.
\item Place all required material in \gls{pcr} Workstation and turn on \gls{uv} light for at least 20 min (gloves, \gls{pcr} tubes rack, open tip boxes, sterile water, pipettes).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Method}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Mix RNA sample and Random Primer Mix (60 \textmu M) in two sterile RNase-free microfuge tubes.
\item Denature RNA for 5 minutes at 70\degree C. Spin briefly and put promptly on ice. \sidenote{This step is optional. However, it improves the cDNA yield for long messenger RNAs and GC-rich RNA regions.}
\item Add the following components to one tube: 10 \uL M-MuLV Reaction Mix and 2 \uL M-MuLV Enzyme Mix. To the negative control tube, add 10 \uL M-MuLV and 2 \uL of water.\sidenote{A control reaction without reverse transcriptase is recommended to examine the DNA contamination in the samples.}
\item  Incubate the 20 \uL cDNA synthesis reaction at 25\degree C for 5 min.\sidenote{If Random Primer Mix is used, an incubation step at 25\degree C for 5 min is recommended before the 42\degree C incubation.}
\item Incubate the 20 \uL cDNA synthesis reaction at 42\degree C for one hour.
\item Inactivate the enzyme at 80\degree C for 5 minutes. 
\item Dilute reaction to 50 \uL with 30 \uL H2O for \gls{pcr}. The \gls{cdna} product should be stored at â€“20\degree C. \sidenote{For downsteam PCR ampli cation, the volume of \gls{cdna} product should not exceed 1/10 of the PCR reaction volume.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{cDNA Quantification with Qubit\texttrademark~ ssDNA Assay Kit}

For this assay, I have $n = 4$ (2 samples + 2 standards), so I mix 4~\uL of reagent (dye) with 796~\uL of buffer, and I use 1~\uL of each of my sample to measure the concentration.\sidenote{Qubit\texttrademark~ ssDNA Assay Kit (\texttt{LOT:1792648}) opened on 20160615.}

\texttt{cDNA -} & 8.94 & 0.017 & 0.151 & 151 \\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The Qubit measure single-stranded DNA in both samples, even in the negative control. This is not acceptable, so I will just stop at this stage (I will not continue with amplifications) and I will just start over again with an extraction.
