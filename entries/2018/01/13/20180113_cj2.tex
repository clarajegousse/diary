\mistake{I was unable to calibrate the Qubit\texttrademark, so I used the old calibration to obtain results.}

The Qubit\texttrademark ~RNA Assay Kit contains two standards: \#1 and \#2. But for some reasons, there are four different tubes for standard \#2. Last time I used this kit, I had trouble calibrating the Qubit\texttrademark and I ended up testing all four standard \#2. This time, to avoid spending time making several working solution, I decide to prepare the assay considering I might have to use the four different standards \#2. This is the reason why I prepare my assay for 8 samples (even though it's not shown clearly in figure \ref{fig:20180113_rna_qubit}): 3 samples + 1 STD\#1 + 4 STD\#2. Unfortunately, I was unable to calibrate the Qubit\texttrademark even after several trials with all different standard \#2. Finally, I gave up on the calibration and used the previous calibration (which I believe was done by me on the 4\textsuperscript{th} January 2018).

I resuspended the RNA pellet in 50~\uL of 10~mM Tris-HCl buffer. Then I used 2~\uL for the Nanodrop analysis, and 5~\uL for the Qubit analysis which means that the final volume is 43~\uL. 

The concentrations of RNA and the calculated quantities of RNA are summarised in table \ref{tab:20180113_nuc_acid_qnt}.
