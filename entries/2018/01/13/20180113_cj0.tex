\subsubsection{Washing and resuspension of nucleic acids}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Pellet nucleic acids from previous steps by centrifugation for 30 min at maximum speed at 4\degree C.
\comment{After the first centrifugation, I can already see a pellet which for both the RNA and the DNA.}
\item Discard carefully supernatent.
\item Repeat previous steps until all RNA and RNA are respectively combined into one single 2mL-Eppendorf tube.
\comment{I must repeat the centrifugation a lot of times, because I ended up with a lot of ethanol.}
\end{enumerate}
