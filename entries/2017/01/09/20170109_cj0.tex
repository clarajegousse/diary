\comment{I arrived at 8:00 AM and the lady at the front desk told me to go to the third floor and wait there until the human ressource officer met me.}

Hróar, the human ressource officer, introduced Anouk Lyver and I to the workplace. 

Then we had a short meeting with Pauline Vannier. She introduced what it means to work at Matís and she gave us some information about the Ph.D. at the University of Iceland.

Topics to look up:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] nested PCR
    \item[-] MALDI TOF biotyper
    \item[-] 16S sequencing
    \item[-] DNA and RNA extraction
    \item[-] MaCuMBa project
    \item[-] marine microbiome \citep{stal2016marine}
\end{itemize}

About the Ph.D. program:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] start thinking about the jury
    \item[-] 3 papers are required to graduate with a PhD in Iceland
    \item[-] 16S \gls{rrna} sequencing
    \item[-] \gls{dna} and \gls{rna} extraction
    \item[-] MaCuMBA project (\url{www.macumbaproject.eu})
\end{itemize}

Pauline highly recommends to use a reference manager like EndNote, Zotero or Mendeley. 

In order to graduate with a PhD in Iceland, it is required to publish at least 3 papers.
