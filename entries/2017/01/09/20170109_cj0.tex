Topics to look up:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] nested PCR
    \item[-] MALDI TOF biotyper
    \item[-] 16S sequencing
    \item[-] DNA and RNA extraction
    \item[-] MaCuMBa project
    \item[-] marine microbiome \cite{stalmarine}
\end{itemize}

About the PhD program:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] start thinking about the jury
    \item[-] 3 papers are required to graduate with a PhD in Iceland
    \item[-] 16S sequencing
    \item[-] DNR and RNA extraction
    \item[-] MaCuMBa project
\end{itemize}

Pauline highly recommends to use a reference manager like EndNote, Zotero or Mendeley. 

In order to graduate with a PhD in Iceland, it is required to publish at least 3 papers.
