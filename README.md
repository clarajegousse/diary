# diary

Chemists and biologists have a lab book. I have my diary. The diary allows to record pretty much everything: pictures of electrophoresis gel, summary of publications with good reference system, interesting websites and piece of code.

## Origin

The original code was written by Jesper Kj√¶r Nielsens Website from Aalborg University, Denmark. It is available at <http://kom.aau.dk/~jkn/latex/latex.php#diary>
